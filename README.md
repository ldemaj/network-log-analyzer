# Network Monitoring Log Analyzer

This project is a lightweight uptime monitoring tool that checks whether a website is accessible and logs the results into an SQLite database. It was built specifically to monitor the status of [my personal portfolio](https://lorena.demaj.dev) and can be adapted for other URLs.

## Project Purpose

 I created this project to demonstrate:
- Bash scripting skills
- SQL (SQLite) usage for logging and analysis
- Proactive monitoring of critical web services

---

## Technologies Used
- **Bash**: To handle logic and uptime checks
- **curl**: To verify HTTP response codes
- **SQLite**: To log and analyze monitoring results using SQL
